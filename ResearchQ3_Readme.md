# Funding Mechanisms and Dollar-Cost Average of Incentives Dataset üí∏

## Overview üåê
This dataset explores and assesses various funding mechanisms employed for distributing incentive funds across the Arbitrum ecosystem. It includes details about different protocols, the types of incentive mechanisms they use, and the specific contracts that have been incentivized. The dataset also aims to calculate the average cost of $1 ARB spent on incentive programs and the corresponding return on investment (ROI) for the Arbitrum ecosystem.

## Dataset Description üìä

### Columns

- **Protocol Name**:
  - Type: String
  - Description: The name of the protocol involved in the incentive program.

- **Protocol Type**:
  - Type: String
  - Description: The type of protocol, such as derivatives, lending, or bridge.

- **Mechanism**:
  - Type: String
  - Description: The specific incentive mechanisms employed by the protocol, which can include quest platforms, trading rewards, LP rewards, and airdrops.

- **Contracts Incentivized**:
  - Type: String
  - Description: The contract addresses that have been incentivized by the protocols.

## Data Collection Period üóìÔ∏è
The dataset covers the period from June 3, 2024, to July 29, 2024, with a focus on the LTIPP (Liquidity and Trading Incentive Program) incentive program, which runs from June 3, 2024, to September 2, 2024.

## Steps of Data Collection üîç

1. **Source Identification**:
   - The primary source of information was the Arbitrum Foundation's grants website (arbgrant website). This platform provided comprehensive details about the protocols and their associated incentive mechanisms.

2. **Manual Data Entry**:
   - Details were manually extracted from the arbgrant website and entered into the dataset. This included information on protocol names, types, mechanisms, and incentivized contract addresses.

3. **Supplementary Research**:
   - For some protocols, additional research was conducted to identify their specific incentive mechanisms. This involved reviewing protocol documentation, official announcements on Medium and Twitter (X), and other social media platforms, as well as other relevant sources.

## Objective üéØ
The primary objectives of this dataset are to:

- Investigate the various funding mechanisms used for incentive programs within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in terms of capital efficiency and value distribution.
- Calculate the average cost of $1 ARB spent on incentive programs and assess the return on investment (ROI).
- Propose new and potentially more efficient incentive mechanisms where applicable.

## Usage üîß
Researchers and analysts can use this dataset to:

- Analyze the effectiveness of different funding mechanisms in distributing incentives.
- Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these mechanisms and their impact on the ecosystem.
- Propose new incentive mechanisms to optimize capital efficiency and value distribution.
