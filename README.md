# Research Project 1

## Overview 🌟
Research Project 1 focuses on **Comprehensive Analysis of Incentive Program Effectiveness and Value Generation for LTIPP Participating Protocols on Arbitrum**. The project aims to:
- Assess sector growth, user interaction, and incentive effectiveness 📈
- Investigate user actions with ARB rewards 🔍
- Explore funding mechanisms and their impact 💵
- Evaluate high-velocity incentive systems and calculate Total Value Returned (TVR) 🚀

## Folder Structure 📁
The project is organized into folders corresponding to each research question, with specific dataset files within each folder:

- **Research Question 1**: Sector Growth, User Interaction, and Incentive Effectiveness
  - **Protocol A/**
    - `Protocol A Transactions.csv`
  - **Protocol B/**
    - `Protocol B Transactions.csv`

- **Research Question 2**: User Actions with ARB Rewards and Unintended Incentivized Actions
  - **Protocol A/**
    - `Protocol A - ARB Reward Recipients.csv`
    - `Protocol A - ARB Reward Utilization.csv`
  - **Protocol B/**
    - `Protocol B - ARB Reward Recipients.csv`
    - `Protocol B - ARB Reward Utilization.csv`

- **Research Question 3**: Funding Mechanisms and Dollar-Cost Average of Incentives
  - `Incentive Distribution Mechanism.csv`

- **Research Question 4**: High-Velocity Incentive Systems and Total Value Returned (TVR)
  - The dataset for this research question is currently under development and has not yet been started 🛠️.

## Current Status 📊
- **Research Question 1**: Data collection is complete. The dataset includes transaction records for various protocols within the LTIPP program.
- **Research Question 2**: Data collection is complete. The dataset includes records of ARB reward distributions and subsequent utilization.
- **Research Question 3**: Data collection is complete. The dataset includes details on funding mechanisms and their effectiveness.
- **Research Question 4**: This research question is yet to be addressed. We plan to start this analysis soon.

## Data Update 🔄
The current datasets are up-to-date as of the latest available date. Remaining data will be updated by the end of September. Please note that the current datasets contain a limited number of columns necessary for our analysis, as compared to the full data available on Dune Analytics.

## Additional Notes 📝
- Some protocol datasets are still pending due to various reasons, including:
  - Confusion or incomplete data ❓
  - Protocols that have not yet received grants 💸
  - Protocols that have not yet utilized the grants they have received 🕒

## Contact 📲
The current dataset contains limited columns than we have access to on Dune as these are the necessary data points for our analysis. For additional dataset around what we have, feel free to connect on Telegram @Chain_L for any queries.

## Usage 📚
Researchers and analysts can use the provided datasets to:
- Conduct detailed analyses on sector growth, user interaction, and incentive effectiveness.
- Explore user actions with ARB rewards and identify unintended incentivized actions.
- Evaluate funding mechanisms and calculate the dollar-cost average of incentives.
- Assess high-velocity incentive systems and compute the Total Value Returned (TVR) metric.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to complete the remaining datasets. Thank you for your interest in Research Project 1! 🙏
